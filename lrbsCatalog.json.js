Wilson Literary Science Writing AwardFrom the bestselling author of the acclaimed Chaos and Genius comes a thoughtful and provocative exploration of the big ideas of the modern era: Information, communication, and information theory.  Acclaimed science writer James Gleick presents an eye-opening vision of how our relationship to information has transformed the very nature of human consciousness. A fascinating intellectual journey through the history of communication and information, from the language of Africa's talking drums to the invention of written alphabets; from the electronic transmission of code to the origins of information theory, into the new information age and the current deluge of news, tweets, images, and blogs. Along the way, Gleick profiles key innovators, including Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace, Samuel Morse, and Claude Shannon, and reveals how our understanding of information is transforming not only how we look at the world, but how we live.",

By avoiding unnecessary revision, libraries can process materials quickly and benefit from economies of scale. Valuable staff time is preserved to process additional materials. However, the touch-it-once mentality is problematic when dealing with special collections materials, since they often differ between manifestations and are primary sources for research that informs their description. This paper discusses the idea of “progressive bibliography,” or proceeding from minimal to fuller descriptions, as an intellectually valid and pragmatically essential methodology.

		"abstract": "Between the end of the Middle Ages and the eighteenth century, what methods were used to monitor and control the increasing number of textsfrom the early handwritten books to the later, printed volumesthat were being put into circulation?  In The Order of Books, Chartier examines the different systems required to regulate the world of writing through the centuries, from the registration of titles to the classification of works. The modern world has, he argues, directly inherited the products of this labor: the basic principle of referring to texts, the dream of a universal library, real or imaginary, containing all the works ever written, and the emergence of a new definition of the book leading to some of the innovations that transformed the relationship of the reader to the text.  The Order of Books will be welcomed by students and researchers of cultural history, and the history of reading in particular.",

		"abstract": "Among the colleagues during the twenty years I worked at the British Library who profoundly influenced me was the historian of the English language, bibliographer and librarian, Robin Alston (1933–2011). Robin's great scholarly achievement was his twenty-volume Bibliography of the English Language from the Invention of Printing to the Year 1800, but the range of his achievements and interests stretched far beyond this. While he was a lecturer at the University of Leeds, he founded Scolar Press to provide cheap facsimiles of historical and literary texts for his students. As editor- in-chief of the Eighteenth Century Short Title Catalogue, which afterwards became the English Short Title Catalogue or ESTC, Robin profoundly influenced the way in which we use printed books from the hand press period. Robin's insistence that this new catalogue should be machine readable and his energy in driving forward the ESTC laid the foundations of such current digital resources as Early English Books Online and Eighteenth- Century Collections Online. Robin was one of the pioneers who shaped the modern digital research environment for humanities scholars.\n\nIn 1990, Robin was appointed Professor of Library and Information Studies at University College London, and he gave his inaugural lecture at UCL, entitled ‘The Battle of the Books’, on 16 February 1993. I attended, with many others from the British Library. The atmosphere was electric.\n\nRobin was known as a charismatic, entertaining and thought-provoking lecturer who provided remarkable insights into current and future developments. He did not fail on this occasion. Robin took his starting point Jonathan Swift's satire, A Full and True Account of the Battle Fought Last Friday between the Ancient and the Modern Books in St James's Library, appended to the Tale of a Tub (1704). Swift imagined the books in the Royal Library joining in the conflict between those who revered classical learning and those who stressed the need for up-to-date modern learning. Swift described solitary volumes of classical learning being threatened by the massed ranks of thousands of modern books.",

		"abstract": "The proliferation of developments in digital technology makes choosing the right method of digitizing resources an increasingly complex process for information organizations. This technology is a key way forward in the twenty-first century, but it is important to develop a strategy to fully assess the costs and benefits of going ahead with a digitization project, and to know when it is the right or the wrong time to do so.  This book presents information managers with all the strategic and practical issues to consider when making the decision to digitize their collections. It runs through the digitization process step by step, outlines the different techniques available to deal with a wide range of library resources, and explores the opportunities offered by a collaborative approach to digitization. Fully case- and evidence-based, the text is supported by examples of digitization projects carried out in various types of libraries around the world, and by an extensive list of sources of further information. Divided into two main sections, &#39;Strategic Decision Making&#39; and &#39;Digitizing Collections&#39;, the chapters include:  Why digitize? The costs and benefits of digitization Selecting materials for digitization Intellectual property, copyright and other legal issues The institutional framework The importance of collaboration Project planning and funding Managing a digitization project Digitization of rare and fragile materials Digitization of audio and moving image collections Digitization of text and images.    Readership: This key international text offers information managers the benefit of a fully strategic approach to digitization and substantial experience drawn from leading digitization projects. It is also essential reading for managers in heritage institutions such as museums, galleries and local archives, and for students of information science.",

MAPP is an international collaborative digital project, funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, that uses digital tools to showcase archival traces of twentieth-century publishing. The twenty-first century has witnessed, and is living through, some of the most dynamic changes ever experienced in the publishing industry, arguably altering our very understanding of what it means to read a book. This book brings to both general readers and scholarly researchers a new way of accessing, and thereby assessing, the historical meanings of change within the twentieth-century publication industry by building a resource which organises, interacts with, and uses historical information about book culture to narrate the continuities and discontinuities in reading and publishing over the last century.",

For memory institutes digitisation of analogue source material, such as historical photographs, is an exciting way to open up and exploit their holdings. The focus on the digital durability of this specific type of digital object enables the investigation of available building blocks for digital preservation, such as strategies, guidelines, standards, procedures and tools. A benchmarked digital capture process, the unambiguous formulation of preservation metadata and the application of persistent identifiers for digital objects, all based on open standards are important building blocks for the realisation of durable digital surrogates of historical photographs. Three methods for creating durable digital objects are assessed in detail. These are the application of a standardised digital image file format, the relevance of the application-independent XML data format for the encoding of a digital image, and unambiguous formulation of preservation metadata with the help of an international standard (ISO/IEC 11179). The research can be considered as a case-study in digital archiving and contributes to the improvement of the durability of digital objects in general.",
