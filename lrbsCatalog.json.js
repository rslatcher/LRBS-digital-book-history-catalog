Preparatory programs dealt with transcription of the manuscripts into electronic form, and with normalisation of their spelling. This yielded a complete frequency table of all variant spellings found in the manuscriptsThe collation itself was designed to cope with widelyvarying texts, with marginalia and with readings tagged as dubious Each reading in each ms was compared in turn with a notional master, and all variants there found in all mss were then tabulated against one another Critical here were two special functions which identified scribal variants and sense variants The accuracy so achieved was estimated at above 99%, including transcription errors. There is no theoretical limit to the number of mss and the length of text COLLATE could process A second article discusses techniques developed to analyse COLLATE's output",

		"abstract": "Interoperability is the key term within the framework of the European-funded research project Interedition,1 whose aim is ‘to encourage the creators of tools for textual scholarship to make their functionality available to others, and to promote communication between scholars so that we can raise awareness of innovative working methods’. The tools developed by Interedition’s ‘Prototyping’ working group were tested by other research teams, which formulate strategic recommendations. To this purpose, the Centre for Manuscript Genetics (University of Antwerp), the Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands (The Hague), and the University of Würzburg have been working together within the framework of Interedition. One of the concrete results of collaboration is the development and fine-tuning of the text collation tool CollateX.2 In this article, we would like to investigate how the architecture of a digital archive containing modern manuscripts can be designed in such a way that users can autonomously collate textual units of their choice with the help of the collation tool CollateX and thus decide for themselves how efficiently this digital architecture functions—as an archive, as a genetic dossier, or as an edition. The first part introduces CollateX and its internal concepts and heuristics as a tool for digitally supported collation. How this tool can be integrated in the infrastructure of an electronic edition is discussed in part two. The third and final part examines the possibility of deploying CollateX for the collation of modern manuscripts by means of a test case: the Beckett Digital Manuscript Project (www.beckettarchive.org).",

		"abstract": "The purpose of the dissertation is to investigate from a theoretical and methodological perspective the different tools that allow automated collation, and study the application of such tools to the creation of a digital critical edition in the context of Classical literature. By doing so, the dissertation examines many foundational but often neglected components of the philological method, such as the definition and wider implication of transcription, reading, and variant. The goal is to provide a reflection on automated collation and the theoretical as well as practical challenges it poses: what is automated collation? How is it performed, and what are the main differences with manual collation? What are the benefits of automated collation? Why has it not been widely adopted yet, despite the fact that it was developed to help scholars? How to process the results of collation programmes? As a case study, a Classical Latin text has been used to test automated collation and to compare the various existing tools. The method I follow in this dissertation is to apply automated collation to a selected text, the Declamations of Calpurnius Flaccus. To this purpose, the manuscript tra-dition, as well as the editio princeps, have been entirely transcribed. Afterwards, the transcriptions have been collated with different collation programmes. The results of the collation with different programmes have been examined and compared, as well as the possibilities offered to scholarly editors for visualising and further processing those results. The content of the thesis is divided into two distinct parts, from theory to practice: a first part discusses the relevance of collation in the broader context of critical editing, introduces automated collation and its various issues, as well as the implications of automated collation for key concepts such as 'witnesses', 'readings' and 'variants'; the second part of the thesis will describe the practical work on the text of Calpurnius Flaccus with automated collation programmes and the visualisation tool that was created to examine the collation results. Each part comprises a short introduction and conclusion which summarises its content and its outcome. In the process of editing a text, the collation of manuscripts and previous scholarly editions is a necessary and fundamental step. The work leading to the production of a critical edition is divided into two phases: the recension of witnesses, followed by the constitution of the text (Chiesa 2002). The editor, therefore, starts with the recension by gathering all the witnesses, manuscripts or editions, bearing a version of the edited text. Collation is the next step: comparing those witnesses to find the differences (or variants) between the versions. Finally, the editor analyses the variants in order to determine the genealogical relationships of the witnesses, if possible, and present those relationships in the form of a stemma codicum. The stemma's purpose is to help the editor produce a text 'as close as possible to the original' (Maas 1958, 1), and decide which variants are accepted as authorial and which variants are rejected as errors that got included in the tradition by the copyists of the manuscripts. After the recension, the editor prepares a critical text, selecting variant readings and making emendations when necessary. Collation is important because it is one of the first stages in the editing process and the data gathered during collation forms the basis upon which the editor will later make critical decisions (Whittaker 1991). Collation is performed because witnesses of a text always contain variant readings, and the editor needs to be in possession of all the alternatives in order to establish the text. As complete collations are not usually published, this represents a regrettable loss of information, especially given the amount of time and effort invested in collation by the editors (West 1973, 63). While collation is an essential part of textual criticism, collation is also a long, tedious and error-prone activity and needs to be checked more than once. For this reason, a new method was created: automated collation, which takes advantage of computers in order to compare texts and find variant readings. Scholars have been developing collation tools since the 1960s, but with limited success at first: what was considered a fairly mechanical process turned out to be more sophisticated than expected (Hockey 2000, 125). Since the pioneering work of Dearing (1962) and Froger (1968), automated collation has been studied for decades and has been constantly improved. In the past 50 years, close to thirty tools have been devised in order to obtain a collation with the support of increasingly complex algorithms. How does automated collation work? To simplify, the tools for automated collation take, as an input, a transcription of each witness that needs to be compared. The transcriptions are then aligned with each other through an alignment algorithm. The task of collation seems to highly benefit from the application of computing methods. The advantages offered by computing methods are various: consistency in the comparison, possibility to reuse the material in order to add new manuscripts to the collation, a common format to share collation data with other scholars. The results of automated collation can also be formatted for further processing, such as building a stemma with a different program or creating a digital scholarly edition. However, automated collation is not completely accepted by the community of scholars, nor is its method fully understood. In 1973, at the beginning of automated collation, scepticism was understandable because of the many restrictions of early tools such as the small number of witnesses collated, or the limitation to comparing lines of poetry. Faced with those limitations, West (1973, 71) stated that 'the time has not yet come when manuscripts can be collated automatically'. Forty years later, in spite of huge technical improvements, opinions have not really changed, to the point that Reeve declared that he was not convinced by computer methods, especially for large manuscript traditions (Reeve 2011, 393). But the computer is indeed supposed to be better at handling large amounts of data, and with more consistency than a human being. In fact, when dealing with large traditions, it is not always possible to sort out the relationships between manuscripts and draw a stemma by hand, yet editors are not keen on turning to electronic methods. Some of the obstacles to the wide adoption of automated collation seem connected to a general misunderstanding. There is a fear that somehow the computer will eventually be replacing the editor, and that editors will lose their right to apply their individual judgement to the texts. Greetham (2007, 23) regrets, for instance, that the role of individual, subjective evaluation 'has not always been recognised, especially by those wishing to emphasise the \"scientific\" aspects of the field'. The importance of individual judgement, and the role of the editor compared to the role of the computer, can be closely related to the black box issue (Sculley and Pasanek 2008): if scholars do not understand what a piece of software does, how can they trust that the programme did not deprive them of making certain choices or applying their own judgement? In the course of my PhD I had several exchanges with colleagues in the field of Classics which have highlighted several underlying misunderstandings on either side. For instance I was once told in an email that 'automated collation is impossible, because computers cannot read manuscripts'. This statement does not recognise, for instance, the fact that computers are collating from transcriptions made by scholars. From this point of view, transcription and collation are strictly connected activities. This statement, however, illustrates perfectly the main tension between traditional, manual collation and automated collation: the difference of methodol-ogy. The confusion arises here because the full transcription of manuscripts is not a part of the traditional heuristics in textual criticism. A generalised lack of tools and guidelines for the production of digital scholarly editions may also explain why automated collation is not the solution of choice.",

Institutions and individuals add thousands of new cultural works to the digital sphere every day, creating new central nexuses of knowledge. How does this affect us politically and culturally? In this book, Nanna Bonde Thylstrup approaches mass digitization as an emerging sociopolitical and sociotechnical phenomenon, offering a new understanding of a defining concept of our time. Arguing that digitization has become a global cultural political project, Thylstrup draws on case studies of different forms of mass digitization—including Google Books, Europeana, and the shadow libraries Monoskop, lib.ru, and Ubuweb—to suggest a different approach to the study of digital cultural memory archives. She constructs a new theoretical framework for understanding mass digitization that focuses on notions of assemblage, infrastructure, and infrapolitics. Mass digitization does not consist merely of neutral technical processes, Thylstrup argues, but of distinct subpolitical processes that give rise to new kinds of archives and new ways of interacting with the artifacts they contain. With this book, she offers important and timely guidance on how mass digitization alters the politics of cultural memory to impact our relationship with the past and with one another.",

Optical character recognition allows researchers to use keywords to search and analyze digitized texts. However, archives of digitized sources also contain large numbers of images. This article shows how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be used to categorize and analyze digitized historical visual sources. We present three different approaches to using CNNs for gaining a deeper understanding of visual trends in an archive of digitized Dutch newspapers. These include detecting medium-specific features (separating photographs from illustrations), querying images based on abstract visual aspects (clustering visually similar advertisements), and training a neural network based on visual categories developed by domain experts. We argue that CNNs allow researchers to explore the visual side of the digital turn. They allow archivists and researchers to classify and spot trends in large collections of digitized visual sources in radically new ways.",

		"abstract": "Sustained dialogue and collaborative work between art historians and technologists has a great deal to offer both fields of inquiry. In this paper, we propose that effective collaborations in Digital Art History, however, require more than just a humanist and a technologist to succeed. Indeed, we find that there are four different roles that need to be filled: Humanist, Technologist, Data Steward, and Catalyst. Our approach is predicated on a few foundational convictions. First, we believe that art historians and technologists occupy distinct problem spaces. As we will outline, although these realms are distinct they are not of necessity in opposition to one another. Second, we bring to the fore essential questions about the status and function of data that must be addressed by the collaborators: what sort of data are being used? What counts as effective and compelling analysis of this data? Third, we recognize that there are certain structural impediments to collaboration, such as different reward structures and motivations. Finally, we assert that each of the participants must have a deep commitment to their particular engagement with the project, which requires sustained effort and the maintenance of disciplinary respect. We firmly believe that the most effective of these projects will not be based on technological solutionism, but rather will be founded in the most humanistic of tools: empathy and respect.",

		"abstract": "This book addresses the gap between print and digital scholarly approaches by combining both praxis and theory in a case study of a new international collaborative digital project, the Modernist Archives Publishing Project (MAPP). MAPP is an international collaborative digital project, funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, that uses digital tools to showcase archival traces of twentieth-century publishing. The twenty-first century has witnessed, and is living through, some of the most dynamic changes ever experienced in the publishing industry, arguably altering our very understanding of what it means to read a book. This book brings to both general readers and scholarly researchers a new way of accessing, and thereby assessing, the historical meanings of change within the twentieth-century publication industry by building a resource which organises, interacts with, and uses historical information about book culture to narrate the continuities and discontinuities in reading and publishing over the last century.",

		"abstract": "This study proposes an archaeology as a means of exploring the practices by which digitally encoded resources are generated, circulated, and received. The discussion grapples with the ambiguous relationship between digitizations and their exemplars in the well-known database, Early English Books Online (EEBO), and suggests ways in which digitizations might be analyzed as witnesses of current perceptions about the past and used accordingly in scholarly research. The article therefore offers a critical reading of EEBO and its digitizations as part of a broader effort to investigate the role of digitally encoded resources in the transmission of ideas and the production of cultural heritage.",

		"abstract": "Within the context of long-term access to digital objects in general this dissertation takes the longevity of digital surrogates of historical photographs into consideration. For memory institutes digitisation of analogue source material, such as historical photographs, is an exciting way to open up and exploit their holdings. The focus on the digital durability of this specific type of digital object enables the investigation of available building blocks for digital preservation, such as strategies, guidelines, standards, procedures and tools. A benchmarked digital capture process, the unambiguous formulation of preservation metadata and the application of persistent identifiers for digital objects, all based on open standards are important building blocks for the realisation of durable digital surrogates of historical photographs. Three methods for creating durable digital objects are assessed in detail. These are the application of a standardised digital image file format, the relevance of the application-independent XML data format for the encoding of a digital image, and unambiguous formulation of preservation metadata with the help of an international standard (ISO/IEC 11179). The research can be considered as a case-study in digital archiving and contributes to the improvement of the durability of digital objects in general.",

		"abstract": "The proliferation of developments in digital technology makes choosing the right method of digitizing resources an increasingly complex process for information organizations. This technology is a key way forward in the twenty-first century, but it is important to develop a strategy to fully assess the costs and benefits of going ahead with a digitization project, and to know when it is the right or the wrong time to do so.  This book presents information managers with all the strategic and practical issues to consider when making the decision to digitize their collections. It runs through the digitization process step by step, outlines the different techniques available to deal with a wide range of library resources, and explores the opportunities offered by a collaborative approach to digitization. Fully case- and evidence-based, the text is supported by examples of digitization projects carried out in various types of libraries around the world, and by an extensive list of sources of further information. Divided into two main sections, &#39;Strategic Decision Making&#39; and &#39;Digitizing Collections&#39;, the chapters include:  Why digitize? The costs and benefits of digitization Selecting materials for digitization Intellectual property, copyright and other legal issues The institutional framework The importance of collaboration Project planning and funding Managing a digitization project Digitization of rare and fragile materials Digitization of audio and moving image collections Digitization of text and images.    Readership: This key international text offers information managers the benefit of a fully strategic approach to digitization and substantial experience drawn from leading digitization projects. It is also essential reading for managers in heritage institutions such as museums, galleries and local archives, and for students of information science.",

		"abstract": "Among the colleagues during the twenty years I worked at the British Library who profoundly influenced me was the historian of the English language, bibliographer and librarian, Robin Alston (1933–2011). Robin's great scholarly achievement was his twenty-volume Bibliography of the English Language from the Invention of Printing to the Year 1800, but the range of his achievements and interests stretched far beyond this. While he was a lecturer at the University of Leeds, he founded Scolar Press to provide cheap facsimiles of historical and literary texts for his students. As editor- in-chief of the Eighteenth Century Short Title Catalogue, which afterwards became the English Short Title Catalogue or ESTC, Robin profoundly influenced the way in which we use printed books from the hand press period. Robin's insistence that this new catalogue should be machine readable and his energy in driving forward the ESTC laid the foundations of such current digital resources as Early English Books Online and Eighteenth- Century Collections Online. Robin was one of the pioneers who shaped the modern digital research environment for humanities scholars.\n\nIn 1990, Robin was appointed Professor of Library and Information Studies at University College London, and he gave his inaugural lecture at UCL, entitled ‘The Battle of the Books’, on 16 February 1993. I attended, with many others from the British Library. The atmosphere was electric.\n\nRobin was known as a charismatic, entertaining and thought-provoking lecturer who provided remarkable insights into current and future developments. He did not fail on this occasion. Robin took his starting point Jonathan Swift's satire, A Full and True Account of the Battle Fought Last Friday between the Ancient and the Modern Books in St James's Library, appended to the Tale of a Tub (1704). Swift imagined the books in the Royal Library joining in the conflict between those who revered classical learning and those who stressed the need for up-to-date modern learning. Swift described solitary volumes of classical learning being threatened by the massed ranks of thousands of modern books.",

In The Order of Books, Chartier examines the different systems required to regulate the world of writing through the centuries, from the registration of titles to the classification of works. The modern world has, he argues, directly inherited the products of this labor: the basic principle of referring to texts, the dream of a universal library, real or imaginary, containing all the works ever written, and the emergence of a new definition of the book leading to some of the innovations that transformed the relationship of the reader to the text.  The Order of Books will be welcomed by students and researchers of cultural history, and the history of reading in particular.",

By avoiding unnecessary revision, libraries can process materials quickly and benefit from economies of scale. Valuable staff time is preserved to process additional materials. However, the touch-it-once mentality is problematic when dealing with special collections materials, since they often differ between manifestations and are primary sources for research that informs their description.

Acclaimed science writer James Gleick presents an eye-opening vision of how our relationship to information has transformed the very nature of human consciousness. A fascinating intellectual journey through the history of communication and information, from the language of Africa's talking drums to the invention of written alphabets; from the electronic transmission of code to the origins of information theory, into the new information age and the current deluge of news, tweets, images, and blogs. Along the way, Gleick profiles key innovators, including Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace, Samuel Morse, and Claude Shannon, and reveals how our understanding of information is transforming not only how we look at the world, but how we live.",
